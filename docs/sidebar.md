#####**Official Platforms:** [DISCORD](https://discordapp.com/invite/dKTSHZC) - [GITHUB](https://github.com/pogodev/) - [FORUMS](https://talk.pogodev.org)

The goal of this sub is to enhance open APIs and discover more about the inner workings of Pokemon Go. Discussions MUST be related to development.

Wednesdays (EST) will be "Implementations Day" where you can show off your work without needing to be related to development.


**Don't post:**

- Advertisement for your website/service. These are allowed on Wednesdays.

- General questions about Pokemon Go that are not development related such as but not limited to:

 - Automatic PTC or Google account generation. This include automated accepting ToS.

 - Selling hacks of any kind.

 - Microtransaction hacks of any kind

 - Automated Bots: If a user can level up without playing the game, it's not allowed.

 - Other exploits that may adversely affect other players. Hypothetical examples: Instant Gym battle wins, server crashing exploits, modification of other user data without their explicit consent.



Any violations will result in an immediate ban.
